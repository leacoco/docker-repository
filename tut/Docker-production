Docker application.

First i will show you how we design and organise our Directory structure.

/application
/logs
/files
Dockerfile
fig.yml.example
docker-compose.yml.example
Makefile

/application = the root directory of our application

/logs for development purposes
/files for development purpose. Both logs and files directory are omitted by git and completly excluded on production. They are there for application to write logs and files.


Dockerfile is the file jenkins uses to build the image. A developer will almost never have to interact with this file

*.yml.example file: These are the files the developer uses to start the application. These files are not use in production. When a developer clones a project. he needs to copy the example file and fill it with values.

Makefile: use to have a standard set of commands for all application and at the same time, hide all kind of complexities to the developer.
